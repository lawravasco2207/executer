# 🧹 Auto-Clean Downloads (7-Day File Remover)

This Python script automatically deletes images in your **Image directory** folder that are **older than 7 days**. It's a lightweight utility to help keep your computer organized and free up storage by cleaning out outdated downloads.

## 🚀 Features

- Deletes all images in the Images directory older than 7 days
- Logs deleted files (optional enhancement)
- Works cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Simple and safe to run

## 📂 How It Works

The script checks the **last modified time** of each image in your Images folder. If it's older than 7 days, it deletes it.

> **Note:** Only files are deleted — not folders. You can change this behavior in the code if needed.
